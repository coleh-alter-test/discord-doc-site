# About the Site

## Why?

Putting things in Discord gives no control over interface, only very basic control over organization, and limited features (images, links, etc). A custom-made markdown-based website (this one!) gives us a relatively low entry barrier to contributing, while greatly expanding the possibilities over a Discord channel.

## How do I contribute? Who can contribute?

Anybody, at any time! If you want to publish something that you think is useful, feel free to make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site); it has a web-based editor, so there's no need to download the project to your computer.

If you want to add a custom feature (such as a new type of diagram for people to use, a change to the script that builds the site, etc), that's also definitely allowed-- same procedure, except if you're adding something that others will use, please do some testing-- try to document any tests you've done in your pull request.

If your addition isn't immediately added, don't worry! Chances are, I just haven't seen it yet. Every request should at least get a comment in response. 

### Can I become an admin and help that way?

I'd be glad to accept help! You don't really need technical experience, but a basic understanding of how Git works is good, as well as knowledge of web development if you want.

## Is this affiliated with {person or group}?

This is made & maintained by @coleh. That's it.

## This page looks bad

If it's an actual bug, please take a screenshot and post it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/issues) on GitHub. If you don't like the design, then still feel free to make an issue-- if you have a pet peeve to fix, a request to make the site better, or any other feedback, I'd love to hear it!

## Is there any way I can contact you that isn't GitHub?

Yeah! I'm @coleh on Discord, and coleh@coleh.net for email.
