# Version 4.0.0 Changes

## Multi-File

This version added support for multi-file major versions.

## Auto-Build

This version added support for markdown files, which are automatically compiled into HTML. All previous versions were transpiled from HTML into markdown for a lower entry barrier to contributing.

## Backreferences!

v4.0.0 added the backreference specification, a formalization of the notation used to reference other messages

## Docs, not rules

This site is now a documentation site, not solely a rule site. This opens up for more applications

## Design changes!

Redesigned color palatte! Better font! More accessibility! Yay!
