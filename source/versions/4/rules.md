# Rules while I am King (and hopefully others use these as well):

## Part 1 - Spam:

What is spamming in one channel certainly isnt in another. For example, 50 pictures of cute animals back to back in #cuteness-overload wont be considered spamming while 50 votes in #voting would be. Unless if you are obviously spamming (sending one message or pic over and over again) then you will be warned to stop. If you continue then you will be muted for 5 mins and you have to delete your messages along with dming me an apology which will be posted on the weekly news updates.

## Part 2 - Politics

Everything political should go in the chat #paulitics if a post turns political then please move the chat to #paulitics. If you keep debating politics while not in #paulitics (after being warned) then you will face the same punishment that people who spam get (Part 1). 
Furthermore, I would like to add that any political opinions are allowed in this server and you will not be banned for sharing your views. If you dont think that trans-genders are human or support the organisation that is blm then you will not be punished. As long as you are not spamming your views (left or right) then you are free to say whatever. That is not to say people wont hate you if you post pictures of yourself at a KKK rally but censorship will not be used while I am King (and hopefully others follow my example).

## Part 3 - Names:

If you have a name that doesnt sound like your name then please put your name in parenthesis. 

example of bad names:

ree  
Ilikepizza  
diamonds  

example of good names:

iron_ore(Bob)  
Bob the Cow  
ree(Bob B.)  
Mr. B
