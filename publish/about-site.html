<h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
<p>Putting things in Discord gives no control over interface, only very basic control over organization, and limited features (images, links, etc). A custom-made markdown-based website (this one!) gives us a relatively low entry barrier to contributing, while greatly expanding the possibilities over a Discord channel.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-contribute-who-can-contribute-">How do I contribute? Who can contribute?</h2>
<p>Anybody, at any time! If you want to publish something that you think is useful, feel free to make a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site">GitHub</a>; it has a web-based editor, so there&#39;s no need to download the project to your computer.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom feature (such as a new type of diagram for people to use, a change to the script that builds the site, etc), that&#39;s also definitely allowed-- same procedure, except if you&#39;re adding something that others will use, please do some testing-- try to document any tests you&#39;ve done in your pull request.</p>
<p>If your addition isn&#39;t immediately added, don&#39;t worry! Chances are, I just haven&#39;t seen it yet. Every request should at least get a comment in response. </p>
<h3 id="can-i-become-an-admin-and-help-that-way-">Can I become an admin and help that way?</h3>
<p>I&#39;d be glad to accept help! You don&#39;t really need technical experience, but a basic understanding of how Git works is good, as well as knowledge of web development if you want.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-affiliated-with-person-or-group-">Is this affiliated with {person or group}?</h2>
<p>This is made &amp; maintained by @coleh. That&#39;s it :) </p>
<h2 id="this-page-looks-bad">This page looks bad</h2>
<p>If it&#39;s an actual bug, please take a screenshot and post it to the <a href="https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/issues">issue tracker</a> on GitHub. If you don&#39;t like the design, then still feel free to make an issue-- if you have a pet peeve to fix, a request to make the site better, or any other feedback, I&#39;d love to hear it!</p>
<h2 id="how-is-this-site-hosted-how-do-we-know-you-re-not-changing-the-rules-">How is this site hosted? How do we know you&#39;re not changing the rules?</h2>
<p>This site is hosted on Netlify, a static site hosting service. Whenever a new version of the site is put up on the <a href="https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/master/">&quot;master&quot; Git branch</a>, GitHub compiles that into a web-viewable version, and then puts that version onto the  <a href="https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/publish/">&quot;publish&quot; Git branch</a>. Netlify sees this and deploys it to their servers. You can be sure I&#39;m not changing the rules behind anyone&#39;s back because Git doesn&#39;t allow that-- every change submitted is cryptographically linked to those made before; it&#39;s extremely difficult if not impossible to falsely edit the pages on this site.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-any-way-i-can-contact-you-that-isn-t-github-">Is there any way I can contact you that isn&#39;t GitHub?</h2>
<p>Yeah! I&#39;m @coleh on Discord, and coleh@coleh.net for email.</p>
