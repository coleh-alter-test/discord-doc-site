<h2 id="what-is-it-">What is it?</h2>
<p>Semantic versions, or &quot;semver&quot;, is a way of formatting version numbers. A bunch of things use it-- &quot;Minecraft 1.15.2&quot; is an example; the first number is the &quot;major version&quot; (1), the second number is the minor version (15), and the third number (2) is the patch version. More information can be found <a href="https://semver.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When making an edit, you should increase the <em>major</em> version if:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a major edit; a complete change of format</li>
</ul>
<p>When making an edit, you should increase the <em>minor</em> version if:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a smaller edit, like a rule addition or removal, that nevertheless changes the meaning of the document</li>
</ul>
<p>When making an edit, you should increase the <em>patch</em> version if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;re only changing or clarifying something (e.g. a grammar fix)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you increase a number, you should reset all less-signifigant numbers to 0 (so a major increase will set both the minor and patch to 0).</p>
<p>Only major versions get preserved forever publically on this website, but <em>all</em> changes (including changes to files that don&#39;t belong to a version, such as this one) are accessible through GitHub in markdown format.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-change-are-older-versions-unchangable-">What can I change? Are older versions unchangable?</h2>
<p>Yeah, kind of. You can change the format (for example, they were transfered from HTML to Markdown in v4.0.0), but their content is unchangable.</p>
