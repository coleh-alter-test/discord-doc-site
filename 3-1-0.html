		<p class="summary">A few things to note about rules:
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
				<li>Admins are permitted to "ignore" the rules if they have a reason to. The only current reason that
					this includes is warning someone else.</li>
				<li>Everyone must follow the rules regularly.</li>
				<li>The rules may change according to votes. Official votes allow Admins to make new rules.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<ul class="large">

			<li id="rules">
				<div class="scroll"></div>
				<div class="scrollcover"></div>
				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Play CS:GO today or you will be banned</li>
					<li>refrain from speaking in any chat at all if someone mentions an uncrustable. This is to worship
						their holy unbeing of being an uncrustable.</li>
					<li>If Black Jesus says something and you don't do it you don't get the n word pass</li>
					<li>Listen to Admins because they're better than you irl totally 100% they're admins because they're
						better i can assure you that is the reason</li>
					<li>If someone sends a meme and you say "ive seen it" or something along those lines, we have the
						right to sell your property to a private corperation.</li>
					<li>If you get exactly a 78.3% on a math test, you get admin</li>
					<li>If you have airpods you aren't allowed to wear them in case you can't hear us when we're telling
						you to play Pit</li>
					<li>If you know of someone named Freddy Horginson, please contact Eli for no reason and tell him hi
						freddy</li>
					<li>Do not verbally abuse any of the bots in their DMs. Bots have feelings too. (except you
						@Oink_Bot (Mark's Bot) no one loves you \d\)moron)</li>
					<li>hEvA uFn!</li>
					<li>Nutting in November also gives the same punishment as rule #5.</li>
					<li>Every time John, Paul, or Adam say they don't want to start a debate, it is your duty to make
						sure that you start a debate and make sure they are well aware they started the debate. Failure
						to do so will result in the loss of 3-5 kidneys, depending on how many stomachs you have.</li>
					<li>If any minecraft server suddenly goes down or crashes, it's Coleman's fault for going negative
						speed.</li>
				</ol>
