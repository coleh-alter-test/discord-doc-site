				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Game hate is no longer punishable</li>
					<li>Admins are not above the law and we shall follow all of the rules</li>
					<li>Obvious spam is punishable</li>
					<li>Server drama is not punishable though I think some people may look down on it</li>
					<li>I am assuming elections will be like Nick said, "we formalize elections to take place during the
						weeks leading up to the summer and winter solstices? Basically, a new King would take power on
						June 21st and December 21st every year. Also, our server anniversary is December 20th, so the
						21st would be the first day of the 'New Year'. One King would serve till June 21st, and another
						would finish out the year. Terms are six months. I think formalizing these dates adds more
						authenticity to the elections, and our server structure as a whole. Note: John would serve until
						December 21st, 2019 if we implemented this, since Charlie left his position early."</li>
